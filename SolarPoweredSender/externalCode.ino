/* Code which is not mine:
 * 
 * I use the foreign code summertime_EU to detect summer-/wintertime
 *
 * If you want to compile my sketch you have to:
 * - Get code for summertime_EU from https://forum.arduino.cc/t/rtc-mit-sommerzeit/168068/3#msg1278536 and append the code to this file.
 * 
 * Thank you jurs for your code!
